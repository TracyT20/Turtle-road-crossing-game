# Turtle-road-crossing-game

Simple turtle road crosshing game built entirely in python using the turtle library and  Object oriented programming (OOP). 

Get the turtle across the road without getting knocked by a cab. You can only move upward (Using the "up arrow key"). 

Each time you level up, the speed of the cabs increase.

Try to get to the highest level possible!
